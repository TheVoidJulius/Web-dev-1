        <p> Antarctica is home to some of the world's largest icebergs, which are formed when massive chunks of glacial ice break off from ice shelves or glaciers, a process known as calving. These icebergs, often breathtakingly beautiful, can vary significantly in size and shape, ranging from small "growlers" to colossal tabular icebergs, some measuring hundreds of kilometers in length. As fresh water ice, icebergs float in the surrounding ocean, with about 90% of their mass submerged beneath the surface. This phenomenon plays a vital role in global oceanic and climatic systems, contributing to sea level changes and influencing oceanic currents. With approximately 90% of the worldâ€™s iceberg population found in Antarctica, these frozen giants continue to capture the fascination of scientists and explorers alike, symbolizing the majestic yet fragile nature of polar ecosystems.</p>
